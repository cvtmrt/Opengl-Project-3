GRADE 110/100

Minimum Requirements: 90 Points
1. (5pts) A meaningful message for the purpose of the simulation/game and the studentâ€™s name 
should be displayed as the title of the window.
2. (5pts) Design a background for your program. It may contain some unmoving objects.
3. (10pts) Design and show at least one target object on the sky. You can make it move as you wish, 
e.g. in an orbit or in a linear / sinusoidal path.
5. (10pts) Design a complex flying object, which will be created when the user clickes on the left mouse 
button. It may be created at the click location or it may be fired from the barrel of a weapon object using 
spacebar.
6. (30pts) After creating the flying object into the scene, it should automatically change its direction 
along the target object. To rotate the complex object you must use the vertex function (having rotation 
and translation type of transformations) that we studied in the lab sessions.
7. (20pts) Flying object will chase the target object.
8. (10pts) If the flying object hits the target object, the flying object or the target object or both 
disappears. If the target object disappears, find a proper way to continue to the simulation/game.
